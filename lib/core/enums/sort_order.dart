// This enum defines the two possible ways we can sort a list:
// from smallest to largest (ascending) or largest to smallest (descending).
enum SortOrder {
  ascending, // Sort items in increasing order (e.g., A to Z, 1 to 10)
  descending, // Sort items in decreasing order (e.g., Z to A, 10 to 1)
}
